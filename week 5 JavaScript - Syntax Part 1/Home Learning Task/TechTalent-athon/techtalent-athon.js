/* Instruction 9:
"Donâ€™t forget about runners exactly 18 years old!
Add anelsestatement that logs a statement to the console telling
the runner to see the registration desk."

In the brief, adults are listed as 18+ and youths as under 18s.
So I am not sure why a separate message would be needed.
When determining if the runner is an adult or not I have used
"age < 18 = youth", and "age >=18 = adult" */
