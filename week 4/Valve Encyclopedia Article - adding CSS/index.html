      <p><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> recieved a huge amount of support following its
      announcement trailer (below). This was mainly due to it being more than 10
      years since the last installment in the series, and a growing meme insinuating
      that <span id="company-name">Valve</span> are inable to count past 3, evidenced by none of their series passing
      the second installment. Will this be their first "...3"?</p>

        It is available for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux. Steam also has an

      <h3>Steam Controller (2015)</h3>
      <p>Featuring dual trackpads, HD haptic feedback, dual-stage triggers, back
        grip buttons, and fully-customizable control schemes, the Steam Controller
        is designed to allow you to play your entire Steam game collection, even
        those designed without controller support in mind.</p>

      <h3>Steam Link (2015)</h3>
      <p>Using Steam Link, you can connect to any computer that's running Steam -
        either on a local network or over the internet. Steam Link is designed to
        take advantage of the horsepower you already have in your home, streaming
        from your current gaming computer by mirroring its experience to your device.
        Video and audio data is sent from your computer to Steam Link, while your
        controller input is sent back in real time.</p>

      <h3>Valve Index (2019)</h3>
      <p>The Valve Index is Valve's first virtual reality headset developed and
        manufactured in house, and is planned to be the launch console for Valve's
        upcoming virtual reality games. Hardware-wise, at release the Valve Index
        was pretty much the peak of VR technology. Featuring a total display
        resolution of 2880x1600, high refresh rate, brilliant tracking audio and a
        pair of incredibly intuitive controllers, this is still the ultimate VR
        kit <strike>one</strike> <strike>two</strike> three years later!</p>

      <h3>Steam Deck (2022)</h3>
      <p>One part Nintendo Switch, one part gaming PC, the Steam Deck is a handheld
      system with gaming power underneath its screen. While it looks like a lot
      like a console, it's as open as a PC, which means you can plug it into a
      monitor or TV, hook up controllers or a mouse and keyboard, even install
      Windows over its Linux innards if you prefer. But the Steam Deck has some
      unique features that give it a more streamlined console-like experience.</p>

      <p>The new version of SteamOS, Valve's Linux-based operating system, will be
      able to seamlessly play games that were built for Windows thanks to a
      compatibility tool called Proton. The system can suspend and resume games,
      too, and supports some fancy new AMD graphics features, like FidelityFX
      Super Resolution upscaling.</p>
